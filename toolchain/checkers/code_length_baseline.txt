# Known code-length violations (grandfathered).
#
# Entries in this file are reported as warnings.  Any NEW violation
# not listed here is reported as an error and will fail `make check`.
#
# To shrink this list: refactor the offending file/function, remove
# the line, and run `make check` to confirm.
#
# Format:
#   path/to/file.py                        – file-length violation
#   path/to/file.py:Class.method           – function-length violation
