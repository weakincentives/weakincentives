## Next Steps

### Completed Work (January 2026) ✅

1. ✅ **Reviewed coverage gaps** - All high-priority specs identified and addressed
2. ✅ **Added critical chapters** - Mailbox, Skills, Monitoring all now fully covered
3. ✅ **Expanded existing chapters** - 16 specs moved from partial/missing to full coverage
4. ✅ **Updated this document** - Coverage improved from 44% to 94%

### Remaining Work (Optional)

1. **Expand HEALTH.md coverage** (Low Priority)
   - Add watchdog details to Chapter 9
   - Document health endpoint patterns
   - Add Kubernetes probe configuration examples

2. **Add WINK_DOCS.md** (Very Low Priority)
   - Document CLI `wink docs` command
   - Add to Chapter 2 or Chapter 17 (CLI Reference)
   - Internal tooling documentation

### Maintenance

- **Monitor** for new specs added to `/specs/` directory
- **Update** this document when new chapters are added
- **Track** any spec changes that require book updates

---

## Notes

### Success Metrics

- **94% coverage achieved** - Up from 44% at start of restructuring
- **All high-priority specs covered** - Mailbox, Skills, Monitoring, Debug UI
- **All core abstractions documented** - Prompts, Tools, Sessions, Resources
- **Production-ready documentation** - Only 2 specs remain incomplete (both low priority)

### Coverage Philosophy

- ✅ Critical user-facing features (MAILBOX.md, SKILLS.md) now have comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Internal implementation details (VERIFICATION.md) appropriately covered within relevant chapters
- ✅ Related specs successfully combined into unified chapters (e.g., MAILBOX + MAILBOX_RESOLVER + VERIFICATION)
- ⚠️ Two remaining gaps (HEALTH.md partial, WINK_DOCS.md missing) are low-priority internal tooling

### Achievement Summary

The book now provides **comprehensive coverage** of the WINK framework. Users can rely on the book as the primary learning resource, with specs serving as implementation references for maintainers.
