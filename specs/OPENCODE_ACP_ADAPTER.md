# OpenCode ACP Adapter Specification (Superseded)

> **This specification has been split into two documents to match the
> two-layer code architecture:**
>
> - **`specs/ACP_ADAPTER.md`** — Generic ACP adapter (`src/weakincentives/adapters/acp/`)
> - **`specs/OPENCODE_ADAPTER.md`** — OpenCode-specific wrapper (`src/weakincentives/adapters/opencode_acp/`)
>
> This file is retained for git history. Refer to the new specs above.
