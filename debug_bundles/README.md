# Debug Bundles

This directory contains debug artifacts generated by the code reviewer example
(`code_reviewer_example.py`). These files are automatically created during
interactive sessions and are excluded from version control.

## Purpose

Debug bundles capture execution state for troubleshooting and analysis:

- **Session snapshots** (`.jsonl`): JSONL files containing session state,
  including workspace digests, plan snapshots, and other slice data.

- **Execution logs** (`.log`): Structured logs from prompt evaluations,
  capturing tool calls, API requests, and timing information.

- **Workspace archives** (`.zip`): Compressed snapshots of the virtual
  filesystem state when using Claude Agent SDK mode.

## File Naming

Files are named using the session UUID:

```
{session_id}.jsonl  - Session state snapshot
{session_id}.log    - Execution logs
{session_id}.zip    - Workspace archive (Claude Agent mode only)
```

## Usage

After running the code reviewer example, inspect these files to understand:

1. What tools were called and in what order
2. How the agent's plan evolved during execution
3. The final state of any modified files
4. Timing and performance characteristics

## Cleanup

These files accumulate over time. Periodically delete old bundles:

```bash
rm debug_bundles/*.jsonl debug_bundles/*.log debug_bundles/*.zip
```

`MainLoop` for programmatic bundle creation.
